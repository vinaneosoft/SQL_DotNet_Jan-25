Q. How many employees present in table
    
select count(employees_id)
from employees
    
select count(last_name)  /*nulls not counted*/
from employees

select count(*) /*it will count if atleast 1 not null value present in that row*/
from employees

 1 is just a placeholder; any constant value (like COUNT(2), COUNT('A'), etc.) would work the same way. 
It doesnâ€™t affect the count.
select count(1)
from employees

below query will give you error as invalid number of arguments
select count()
from employees

select count('')
from employees   /*output 0*/

select count(' ')
from employees   /*number of rows employee table*/

below query will give you error as invalid number of arguments
select count(last_name, city)
from employees


SELECT dept_code, count(employees_id), LISTAGG(first_name || ' ' || last_name, ',')
FROM employees
group by dept_code
