Note : if u want to use oracle reservedwords as column name then mention them in ""
    in create table query
while selecting that column in select clause, also use ""
CREATE TABLE sample_table3 (
    id INT,
    "in" VARCHAR2(50) 
);
insert into sample_table3 values(1, 'hi');

select "in" from sample_table3;
