Q. Assign a row number to the order we are fetching
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
        ORDER BY employees_id
    ) row_num, 
   employees_id, 
    first_name
FROM 
    employees;

SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
        ORDER BY dept_code
    ) row_num, 
   count(employees_id),
 	dept_code
FROM 
    employees
group by dept_code


Q. Fetch only particular row / rows 


with eids_with_row as (
    SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
        ORDER BY employees_id
    ) row_num, 
   employees_id, 
    first_name
FROM employees
)

SELECT * FROM eids_with_row
WHERE row_num >= 1 and row_num <= 10;


Database : rowid unique, table : rownum unique
select rowid,rownum, e.*
from employees e;
   
select rowid,rownum, d.*
from departments d;

how rowid are getting generated and assigned to each row of table

Solution : inline view
select count (*) from 
    (
	select employees_id from employees where dept_code='SM'
		union
	select employees_id from employees where dept_code='LD'
);

Soln : subquery
select count(*) from employees where employees_id in
(select employees_id from employees where dept_code='SM'
union
select employees_id from employees where dept_code='LD')

soln : CTE

with sm_ld_emps as(select employees_id from employees
where dept_code = 'SM'
    union
select employees_id from employees
where dept_code = 'LD')
select count(*) from sm_ld_emps;
